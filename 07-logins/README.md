For this one, you'll need to run a command from the command line to create a new user and password.

## First time only

If you haven't created keys yet, you'll want to do that first.

    ./[platform]/altcloud[.exe] keys

## Create a user

You can either provide a password, or one will be genereted for you.

    ./[platform]/altcloud[.exe] add-user some-username [some-password]
